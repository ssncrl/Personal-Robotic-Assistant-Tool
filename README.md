# PRAT
Project Summary:
A low-cost robotic assistant arm designed to help people perform small physical tasks by controlling it with their voice (pressing buttons, flipping switches, moving objects, grabbing objects). Built with Arduino, Python, ML, SpeechRecognition and Computer Vision

Tech Stack: Arduino/Pico, Python (GUI + voice), servos, sensors.


Features:
- multi-joint robotic arm
- voice-controlled routines

  
Expected Outcome: 

"Hey bot, grab the pencil."

Robot sees the object, plans the motion, picks it up, and hands it over
