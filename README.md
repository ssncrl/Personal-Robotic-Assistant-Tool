My Goal
Design and build a fully autonomous, desk-side robotic assistant that uses computer vision, ML, and voice commands to interact with objects — aimed at aiding users with disabilities.

Expected Outcome: 

"Hey bot, grab the pencil."

Robot sees the object, plans the motion, picks it up, and hands it over
